1. Consider a structure, which has multiple regions.
Some of them are semiconductors and others are insulators.

For this structure, you assign three variables:

aaa: It is a variable defined on the entire structure.
bbb: It is a variable defined only on the semiconductor regions.
ccc: It is a variable defined only on the insulator regions.

Actual values of three variables are not important.
Determine them in your way.

Construct a solution vector, x.
When a user provides (Region,Vertex,Variable) information, your code should return an index.
This index must satisfy the following relation:
x(index) = Variable^Region_Vertex
(You know the meaning of the above equation. If you don't, please send me a DM.)

Of course, a user provides an invalid query, for example, asking the ccc variable for a semiconductor region, your code must make an error report.

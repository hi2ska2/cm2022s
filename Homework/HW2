1. Solve the Laplace equation for a triangle.
On the first and third vertex, the solution is 0 and 1, respectively.
Therefore, you have to calculate the solution at the second vertex.

Your code accepts three coordinates.
Using these three coordinates, calculate the solution.
Assume that an obtuse triangle is not allowed.

In your report, consider the following three cases:

Case1) (0, 0) (1,0) (1,1)
Case2) An equilabteral triangle
Case3) (0.0) (3,0) (3,4)

In addition, add more test exmplaes generated by yourself.
